## 🚀 Overview

Stellarium is a space survival and exploration game where the player travels across several hostile planets, builds bases, crafts their own spaceship, tames alien creatures, and ultimately faces a colossal final boss: *Eclipse*.

This project was clearly too ambitious for a solo 17-year-old developer — and I was aware of it. But I still wanted to do it, and I saw it through. I finished the game, despite numerous flaws both technically and structurally.

* Engine: Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints)
* Development time: 15 months, solo
* Objectives: Build an immersive universe with open gameplay and deep crafting, taming and combat systems.
* No source code is published here — this was developed before I started formal programming education.

## 🎵 Sound Design

The music wasn't composed by me but carefully curated from lesser-known tracks that perfectly matched the mood of each environment and encounter. Each theme was picked to enhance immersion and narrative atmosphere.

## 🗓️ Project Status

> **Finished but no longer maintained.** The project is not under active development. No technical support provided.

This game is preserved as a snapshot of my first serious solo dev experience, and as a foundation from which I’ve since grown.

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

Today, I work on more professional and maintainable projects, using modern development practices, Git versioning, clean architectures, and well-crafted UX.
